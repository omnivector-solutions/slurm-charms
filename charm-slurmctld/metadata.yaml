    This charm provides slurmctld, munged, and the bindings to other utilities
    that make lifecycle operations a breeze.

    slurmctld is the central management daemon of SLURM. It monitors all other
    SLURM daemons and resources, accepts work (jobs), and allocates resources
    to those jobs.  Given the critical functionality of slurmctld, there may be
    a backup server to assume these functions in the event that the primary
    server fails.
