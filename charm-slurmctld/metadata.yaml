    This charm provides slurmctld, munged, and the bindings to other utilities
    that make lifecycle operations a breeze.

    slurmctld is the central management daemon of Slurm. It monitors all other Slurm
    daemons and resources, accepts work (jobs), and allocates resources to those jobs.
    Given the critical functionality of slurmctld, there may be a backup server to assume
    these functions in the event that the primary server fails.
