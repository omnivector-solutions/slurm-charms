      'Name by which the partition may be referenced (e.g. "Interactive"). This
      name can be specified by users when submitting jobs. If the PartitionName
      is "DEFAULT", the values specified with that record will apply to
      subsequent partition specifications unless explicitly set to other values
      in that partition record or replaced with a different set of default

      Used by the nrpe subordinate charms.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups.
      If left empty, the nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup
  nhc-conf:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      Custom extra configuration to use for Node Health Check.
      These lines are appended to a basic nhc.conf provided by the charm.
